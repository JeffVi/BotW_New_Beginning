# BotW New Beginning

## ChangeLog

### ver 0.1
**Fast travel** has been **disabled for every shrine**. *But you can still use towers and labs.*

### ver 0.2
**Raw food** does **not heal** anymore, **roasted/chilled restore a little**. *Numbers will change but it's basically one heart for now.*

#### Cooking
**Cooking** is focused on the **effects** of the food used, and so the healing is **minor** (0.25) for ingredients that **add an effect**.

**MAX items** doesn't give **extra hearts** when cooked, they now **restore** a **fixed ammount** of HP instead. *No more easy Durans.*

Two **identical MAX items** do **not add up their healing**. *But different ones do.*

Items without any effect *eg apples* will heal a litle to compensate.

**Dubious food** does **not heal** anymore. *What did you expected?*

**Fairies** now only heal for **3 hearts**. *You might want to cook thoses...*
